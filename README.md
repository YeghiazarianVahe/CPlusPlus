# Professional C++ & STL Roadmap

Welcome to the **Professional C++ & STL Roadmap** repository. This is a structured path to mastering modern C++ with in-depth coverage of STL, data structures, algorithms, and advanced topics. Each phase includes concepts, coding tasks, and projects designed to help you build a professional C++ skillset.

---

## ðŸ§­ Roadmap Overview

### Phase 0: Setup & GitHub
- Install compiler (g++, clang++) and IDE (VS Code, CLion)
- Setup GitHub repository with structured folders

### Phase 1: C++ Basics
- Syntax, data types, control flow, memory management
- Tasks: calculator, dynamic array, matrix calculator

### Phase 2: Object-Oriented Programming
- Classes, inheritance, polymorphism, RAII
- Tasks: Bank system, shape hierarchy, operator overloading

### Phase 3: Templates & Generic Programming
- Function/class templates, specialization, variadic templates
- Tasks: Template-based container classes, sorting, type-specific logic

### Phase 4: Memory Management
- Pointers, smart pointers, rule of 3/5/0, move semantics
- Tasks: Manual memory manager, custom smart pointer

### Phase 5: STL Containers
- Vectors, lists, maps, sets, stacks, queues, iterators
- Tasks: LRU cache, task scheduler, word frequency

### Phase 6: STL Algorithms
- `sort`, `find`, `count`, `accumulate`, lambdas
- Tasks: transform string, custom sort, range algorithms

### Phase 7: Data Structures with STL
- Linked list, BST, heap, trie, graph
- Tasks: Implement core structures, traversal/search algorithms

### Phase 8: Modern C++ & Best Practices
- Const correctness, namespaces, ranges, `constexpr`, `auto`, `concepts`
- Tasks: Rewrite with idioms, modular code refactoring

### Phase 9: Projects & Portfolio
- Student system, RPG game, CLI tools, encryption utilities
- Document each project with clear structure and explanations

## ðŸ“Œ Git & Contribution Notes
- Use clear, consistent commit messages:
  ```
  git commit -m "Phase 3: Added Stack class template"
  ```
- Weekly progress should be logged in `PROGRESS.md`
- Each directory should have a `README.md` explaining its contents, purpose, and compile instructions

---

## ðŸš€ Goals
By the end of this roadmap, you will:
- Master modern C++ syntax and memory models
- Be fluent in using STL containers and algorithms
- Know how to write generic, efficient, idiomatic C++
- Be capable of implementing real-world applications
- Build a GitHub portfolio to showcase your C++ proficiency
