#include "../include/Arena.hpp"

// No additional methods beyond what’s defined inline in the header.
// If you had chosen to put some methods out‐of‐line, you would define them here.
// For completeness, here’s Arena.cpp—with everything implemented inline:

// Note: In Arena.hpp, allocate(), release_all() and the destructor are already
// implemented inline within the class definition. Therefore, this .cpp file
// simply exists to be compiled (it can be empty, or you can leave it as follows).
